## Starting enigma-anchor

The recommended way of using ***enigma-anchor*** is to login as the `enigma-anchor` user. This will automatically start a command line interface with a pre-defined set of commands for certificate management. It is also possible to limit the access of this user to your server's resources and manage the use of the account.
