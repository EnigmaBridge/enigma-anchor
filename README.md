# Documentation of The enigma-anchor Project

This project's goal is to create a simple to use wrapper for certbot and potentially other clients for letsencrypt PKI. The project has 3 main goals:

  - simplify use of letsencrypt as much as possible so that anyone can use it without learning anything about Letsencrypt;
  - include strong mechanisms allowing trouble-shooting and quick support for new platforms and configurations of users; and
  - introducing management features allowing users monitor how their certificate management behaves and identify potential attacks.
